This is the FyberSDK dev project.

It contains:
1. Demo project on target "DCHFyberOffersSDKDemo"
2. SDK source code on target "DCHFyberOffersSDK"
3. SDK testing target "DCHFyberOffersSDKTests"
4. "Framework" target used to build the shippable Framework.

How to build the Framework:
1. Open XCode
2. Select "Framework" target
3. Build or run. 

Output: the framework build folder should open with the just compiled framework inside.

Disclaimer: the framework does not include Simulator "arm64" arhitecture. Most probably it won't support the Simulator target on the new M1 Macs.
